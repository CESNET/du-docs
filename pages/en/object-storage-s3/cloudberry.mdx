# CloudBerry Explorer for Amazon S3

[CloudBerry Explorer](https://cloudberry-explorer-for-amazon-s3.en.softonic.com/) is an intuitive file explorer that helps you manage your S3 account as if it were another folder on your local drive. The program has a double-pane interface and acts as an FTP client, with each window dedicated to a single folder. These locations are not fixed and can be switched to suit your current task: a local computer and a remote S3 server, two local folders, or even two S3 accounts. 

## Cloudberry Installation
You can use exe installer from [the oficial websites of Cloudberry](https://cloudberry-explorer-for-amazon-s3.en.softonic.com/). When you start the program, it will be always informed about the registration options. Registration is free. Then you receive the key via e-mail and then all pop-ups are avoided.

!!! warning
