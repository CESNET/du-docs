Then insert **Host name** `s3.clX.du.cesnet.cz` where replace **X** with the number of the cluster associated with your S3 account. Port `443` will be pre-filled automatically. Copy `access_key` into the field Access key ID and `secret_key` into the Secret access key - you received both of these keys encrypted from the administrators.
