## Multipart upload/download configuration

If you need to upload and download large objects (typically larger than 5GB) you need to configure so-called multipart uploads/downloads. A large object is divided into multiple parts and then uploaded/downloaded. This functionality can also optimize the data throughput. On the data storage system are the objects represented as one object again.

Open the tool S3 Browser and then click in the main menu on **1. Tools** and then on **2. Options**.
